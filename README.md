# MacEditor
 It's a basic text editor that also has a Syntax Highlighter with set words. You can edit and save the fonts and syntax colors and even the text editor's tab indent! The info for the stuff is on the bottom of the window.

# Information - MANDATORY
So, this information is NEED-TO-KNOW because I need to let anyone that might want to use this program, that it has absolutely
NO shortcuts because I forgot them. But, on the plus side, pretty much everything can be saved.

# Other
I unfortunately couldn't get the RichTextBox's font to be displayed and updated to a label, but I managed to make editable colors for
the Syntax Highlighting feature.
